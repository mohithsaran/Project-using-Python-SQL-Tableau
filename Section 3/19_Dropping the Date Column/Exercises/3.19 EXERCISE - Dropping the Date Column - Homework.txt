Exercise #1:

Do the same thing with the ‘Date’ column – drop it from the df_reason_mod DataFrame.

Exercise #2:

Re-order the columns in df_reason_mod so that “Month Value” and “Day of the Week” appear exactly where “Date” used to be. That is, between “Reason_4” and “Transportation Expense”.

We are done with working on the ‘Date’ column. So, it is a clever moment to stop to create a checkpoint.

Exercise #3:

Create another checkpoint, calling the new variable df_reason_date_mod.
