Exercise:

Create a new notebook file where you will need to solve the exercises we provide throughout this business case study.

Then, drop the ‘Age’ column from df and assign the newly obtained data set to a new variable, called df_no_age.

Note: The exercises aim at solidifying your programming skills. They are less directed towards applying business or economic intuition, which is something we have exclusively left for the video lectures.

Start your notebook by running the following code:

import pandas as pd
raw_csv_data = pd.read_csv("D:/Test/Absenteeism_data.csv")
df = raw_csv_data.copy()
df = df.drop(['ID'], axis = 1)
df

Then, as solutions to these exercises, we will only provide the code you need to run afterwards.
